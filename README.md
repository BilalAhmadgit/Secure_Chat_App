# Secure_Chat_App
A real-time, end-to-end encrypted chat application that combines modern cryptography with user-friendly interfaces for secure communication. Built with Python, this project implements ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption and Diffie-Hellman key exchange to ensure messages remain confidential and tamper-proof during transmission.
